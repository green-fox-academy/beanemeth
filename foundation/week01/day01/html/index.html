    <p>A logic gate is an idealized model of computation or physical electronic device implementing a Boolean function, 
        a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output.</p>
    <p>ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange (pronounced "ask-key"). Computers can only understand numbers, 
        so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort. </p>
        <p>Random-access memory (RAM; /r√¶m/) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, 
            typically used to store working data and machine code.</p>
            <p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. 
                Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer.</p>
                <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers,
                     services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.</p>
                     <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model 
                         for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.</p>
