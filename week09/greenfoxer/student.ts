/* Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, and has the following additional
fields:
previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
methods:
getGoal(): prints 'My goal is: Be a junior software developer.'
introduce(): prints 'Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization who skipped skippedDays days from the course already.'
skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays
The Student class has the following constructors:

Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0
Student(): sets name to Jane Doe, age to 30, gender to female, previousOrganization to The School of Life, skippedDays to 0 */
